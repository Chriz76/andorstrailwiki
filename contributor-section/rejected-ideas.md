# Rejected Ideas

## Music

Large downloads, low priority \(but if we find the right content/composer/license it could be an option\)

## Classes

The player should develop their character based on their actions along the course of the game, not based on a predefined path of advancement.

## Multiplayer

The app would need internet access permission and we would need a central server \(which introduces real-world costs and needs maintenance, in addition to actually coding it\). Would have to solve the issue with people that want to cheat.

## Online Play

No features that need internet access.

## Teleporting

No fast travel. Boats maybe???

## Auto-leveling Monsters

Similar to Oblivion, their difficulty should be predetermined based on the area that they spawn in.
